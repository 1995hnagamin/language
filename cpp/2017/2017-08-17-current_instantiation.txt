                            (1a.2) a nested class of a class template,
                            (1a.3) a member of a class template,
                         or (1a.4) a member of a nested class of a class template,
    the injected-class-name of    (1b.1) the class template
                               or (1b.2) nested class,

    (2)
    in the definition of    (2.1) a primary class template
                         or (2.2) a member of a primary class template,
    the name of the class template
        followed by
            the template argument list of the primary template (as described below)
                enclosed in <>
    (or an equivalent template alias specialization),

    (3)
    in the definition of a nested class of a class template,
    the name of
        the nested class
            referenced as a member of the current instantiation,

 or (4)
    in the definition of    (4a.1) a partial specialization
                         or (4a.2) a member of a partial specialization,
    the name of the class template
        followed by
            the template argument list of the partial specialization
                enclosed in <>
    (or an equivalent template alias specialization).

    If the nth template parameter is a parameter pack,
    the nth template argument is
        a pack expansion
          whose pattern is the name of the parameter pack. (4b)
